This Method takes a 2-dimensional, jagged array of ints. This array represents how much money each customer has in each of his/her accounts. The first dimension of the array represents each Customer. The second dimension of the array represents the Balance in each of that customer's accounts.

For example, the first customer (customer #0) might have three accounts: accounts[0][0] = 100, accounts[0][1] = 200, and accounts[0][2] = 300. This customer has a total of 600 (dollars). The second customer (customer #1) might have only one account: accounts[1][0] = 500. This customer has a total of 500 (dollars). And the third customer (customer #2) might have four accounts: accounts[2][0] = 400, accounts[2][1] = 600, accounts[2][2] = 500, and accounts[2][3] = 0. This customer has a total of 1,500 (dollars).

If your method is given the input described above, it should return that the wealthiest customer has 1,500 (dollars).
